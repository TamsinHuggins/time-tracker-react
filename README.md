# Time Tracker

### Overview

Time Tracker is a portfolio project application which I built in React.js in order to develop and demonstrate my front end web development skills, including building from a design, creating interactive custom React components, and implementing device-responsive styling for desktop, phone and tablet using media queries. Time Tracker is a user interface which allows the user to visualise their time spent on different activities (e.g. work, exercise, social), over different time scales (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly). This interface would make up one part of a larger application: this interface would act as the end of the data pipeline, displaying for the user an interactive breakdown of their personal statistics.
