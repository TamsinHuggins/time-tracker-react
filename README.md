# Time Tracker

### Overview

Time Tracker is a portfolio application which I built to develop and demonstrate my front end web development skills in React.js, including building from a design, creating interactive custom React components, and implementing device-responsive styling for desktop, phone, and tablet. Time Tracker is a user interface which allows the user to visualise their time spent on different activities (e.g. work, exercise, social), over different time scales (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly). This interface would make up one part of a larger, data-driven application: I have built the final part of this data pipeline, which displays an interactive breakdown of the user's personal statistics.

### What does Time Tracker do?
Time Tracker displays the number of hours the user has spent on different activities over the past day, month or week. The app has buttons which allow the user to select the timescale in which they want to view their data. Time Tracker adapts to the size of the user's view window, adaptively changing its layout depending on whether the viewer is viewing on a desktop, tablet or phone screen.

### Challenges associated with building Time Tracker

	- making design decisions (e.g. multiple ways to apply CSS to achieve 		the design layout. Example: hardcode the <Card> width or make it 			scaled

	- when should something be a React component?
